User Authentication and Authorization on Spring Boot

To support both authentication and authorization, we 

   -> implemented an authentication filter to issue JWTS to users sending credentials,
   -> implemented an authorization filter to validate requests containing JWTS,
   -> created a custom implementation of UserDetailsService to help Spring Security loading user-specific data in the framework,
   -> extended the WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter class to customize the security framework to our needs.
